# Make Same-day deliveries with Blip

To get started integrating same-day deliveries into your application, use  `require('blip.delivery')('YOURSTOREID')` and replace `YOURSTOREID` with the storeID you recieved after signing up for an account.

> **Registration:** You can get a storeID by signing up at **www.blip.delivery**  or contacting sales.

## Get a delivery Quote

To get a new delivery quote, use `getQuote(options)` where `options` is an object containing a delivery address, and a pickup address.

    var blip = require('blip.delivery')('YOURSTOREID');
    
    // Enter the full address along with the locality/sublocality
    
    const quote = await blip.getQuote({
	    pickupAddress: "156 Enfield Place, Mississauga, ON",
	    deliveryAddress: "3573 Mississauga Rd, Mississauga, ON"
	})

## Create a delivery request

To create a new delivery request, use `createNewDelivery(options)` where `options` is an object containing required delivery details.

    var blip = require('blip.delivery')('YOURSTOREID');
    
    // All fields are required
    
    const delivery = await blip.createNewDelivery({
